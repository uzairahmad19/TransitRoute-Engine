# Delhi Metro Path Finder

A Java implementation of Delhi Metro's path finding system using graph algorithms (BFS and Dijkstra's).

## Features

- Finds shortest paths between metro stations
- Two algorithm implementations:
  - BFS for minimum stops
  - Dijkstra's for shortest distance or minimum time
- CSV-based data loading for easy maintenance
- Clean OOP design with proper separation of concerns

## Data Format

csv


## Technologies

- Java 11+
- Graph algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra's)
- CSV data processing
- Object-oriented design patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Add GUI interface
- Include real-time delays
- Add fare calculation
